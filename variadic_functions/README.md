What Are Variadic Functions?
A variadic function is a special type of function that can accept a variable number of arguments.
Unlike regular functions, which have a fixed number of parameters, variadic functions allow flexibility by allowing any number of arguments to be passed.
Syntax of a Variadic Function:
A variadic function has at least one fixed parameter (with a known data type) followed by an ellipsis (...) as the last parameter.
The ellipsis indicates that additional arguments can be passed.
