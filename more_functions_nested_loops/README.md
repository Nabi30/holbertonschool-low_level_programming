More Functions and Nested Loops in C
More Functions:

In C programming, functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. More functions refer to the creation and utilization of additional functions beyond the main function.
Functions can be declared and defined to perform tasks such as calculations, data manipulation, and I/O operations.
Additional functions help in modularizing code, making it more organized, readable, and easier to maintain.
To create a function, you declare its prototype (signature) before the main function or define it directly.
Example:

// Function prototype
int add(int a, int b);

// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
Nested Loops:

Nested loops are loops inside other loops.
They are used when you need to repeat a set of instructions multiple times, and each iteration of the outer loop contains another loop inside it.
Nested loops are commonly used for tasks such as iterating through multi-dimensional arrays and generating patterns.
Example:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
        printf("* ");
    }
    printf("\n");
}
This code prints a square pattern of stars.
More functions and nested loops are essential concepts in C programming, allowing developers to write efficient and structured code to solve various problems.
