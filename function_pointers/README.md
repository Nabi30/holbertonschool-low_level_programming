 Function Pointers in C
Definition:

Function pointers are variables that store the address of functions in C.
They allow functions to be passed as arguments to other functions, returned from functions, and stored in data structures.
Function pointers enable dynamic dispatch and callback mechanisms, enhancing the flexibility and extensibility of C programs.
Declaration:

To declare a function pointer, you specify the return type and parameter types of the function it points to.
Syntax: return_type (*pointer_name)(param1_type, param2_type, ...).
Example:

int (*ptr)(int, int); // Pointer to a function that takes two ints and returns an int

Initialization:
Function pointers can be initialized with the address of compatible functions.
Example:

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int (*ptr)(int, int) = &add; // Initializing pointer with address of 'add' function

Function Call via Pointers:

To call a function through a pointer, you use the dereference operator * or the arrow operator ->.
Example:

int result = (*ptr)(3, 4); // Calling 'add' function via pointer

Function pointers are a powerful feature of C programming, commonly used in scenarios such as callback functions, event handling, and implementing polymorphism.
