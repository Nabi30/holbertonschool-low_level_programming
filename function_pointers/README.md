Function pointers in C are variables that store the address of a function, enabling dynamic function calls through the pointer.
They allow for passing functions as arguments to other functions, enabling callbacks and implementing function arrays.
Unlike data pointers, function pointers point to executable code rather than data.
Function pointers are declared using syntax similar to the function they point to, with an asterisk (*) preceding the name.
They are commonly used in scenarios like implementing callback mechanisms, creating function arrays, and dynamic dispatching.
