Pointers, Arrays, and Strings in C

Pointers in C:
Pointers are variables that store memory addresses.
They are powerful tools for working with memory and data structures in C.
Pointers allow you to access and manipulate memory directly, enabling efficient memory management.
You can use pointers to dynamically allocate memory, pass parameters by reference, and create complex data structures like linked lists and trees.
Example:

int *ptr; // Declaration of an integer pointer
int num = 10;
ptr = &num; // Assigning the address of 'num' to the pointer

Arrays in C:
Arrays are collections of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.
They provide a convenient way to store and access multiple values of the same type.
Arrays in C are zero-indexed, meaning the first element has an index of 0.
Example:

int arr[5]; // Declaration of an integer array with 5 elements
arr[0] = 10; // Assigning value to the first element

Strings in C:
Strings in C are arrays of characters terminated by a null character '\0'.
They are used to represent text or sequences of characters.
C does not have a built-in string data type, so strings are typically represented as character arrays.
Example:

char str[10] = "Hello"; // Declaration of a string array

Pointers, arrays, and strings are fundamental concepts in C programming and are extensively used in various applications for memory management, data manipulation, and string processing.
