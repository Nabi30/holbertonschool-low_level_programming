Structures in C:
Structures are user-defined data types in C used to group different types of variables under a single name.
They allow you to create complex data structures by combining variables of different types.
Each variable within a structure is called a member or field.
You define a structure using the struct keyword, followed by the structure's name and its members enclosed in curly braces.
Example:

struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float salary;
};
Typedef in C:
typedef is a keyword in C used to create aliases for existing data types.
It helps improve code readability and maintainability by allowing you to define custom names for data types.
With typedef, you can create a new name for a data type, making the code easier to understand.
Example:

typedef unsigned long int ulong;
Now, ulong can be used as a shorthand for unsigned long int.
Structures and typedef are commonly used together to create more readable and organized code, especially when dealing with complex data structures. They are fundamental concepts in C programming and are widely used in various applications.
