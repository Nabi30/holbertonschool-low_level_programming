Recursion in C
Definition:

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem.
Key Components:

Base Case: Every recursive function must have one or more base cases, which are conditions where the function stops calling itself and returns a value. Without a base case, the recursive function may enter an infinite loop.
Recursive Case: This is where the function calls itself with a modified input parameter. It contributes to breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems until reaching the base case.
Example:

// Function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion
int factorial(int n) {
    // Base case
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    // Recursive case
    else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}
Advantages:

Allows for elegant solutions to problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.
Simplifies code and makes it easier to understand for certain types of problems.
Limitations:

Can consume more memory and time compared to iterative solutions.
Not suitable for problems with a large number of recursive calls due to the risk of stack overflow.
Recursion is a powerful concept widely used in programming for solving problems efficiently, especially in scenarios where a problem can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems.
